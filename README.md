# Numerical Evolution of the Moon's Magma Ocean

This repository contains code for simulating the thermal evolution of the lunar magma ocean. The model is based on solving the heat conservation equation within the magma ocean and can be adapted for studies of other celestial bodies. 

The **user_guide.pdf** file provides detailed information on input and output parameters, as well as instructions for using the code. Additionally, the **run.py** file serves as an example of usage for a reference case.

To run the code, ensure you have Python installed on your system. The recommended version is Python 3.6 or higher.

This code was developed as part of a project which resulted in the following publication in which details of the method can be found:
